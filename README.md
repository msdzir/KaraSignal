## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Java 17, 20
* Maven 3
* Redis
* MySQL 8 and PostgreSQL
* React
* TypeScript

### Installing

* To install, it is enough to download all the services. The program execution process is explained in the next section. Before running, please install all project dependencies, including Java and Maven.
* Before running, it is necessary to set configurations for each service, such as connection string, database, etc., which are explained in the README of each service separately.

### Executing program

The execution process of each service is listed separately in the README of that service. You should follow the path of running the services from the following, which service should be run first.
* First, you need to run Server Discovery. This service is like a DNS for hosting other microservices. Each microservice introduces itself to Server Discovery at the time of startup, as a result, other services can access its host and port to communicate with each other through the service name, which prevents hard-coding of the services' IP.
* You can run the rest of the services in any order, except for the User Dashboard (API) service, which must be run last.
* After running all the services, you can run the UI so that you can access the user interface of the program.
